The article by Calo mentions the use of "Formalizing websites" in order to place people on a greater guard about what they disclose. 
The article also talks about the Carnegie Mellon's Experiment using an Online Survey (Pg 1039), where researchers observed that people answered questions more honestly on a casual website in comparison to a more formal website.

But is it not true that people place immense trust on formal brands/corporates and many-a-times assume they would always safeguard the consumer?

When buying goods from a well-reputed brand, people may not invest a lot of time researching about the product, because they assume that a corporate always provides authentic and tested products/services. For example, people may blindly order the new iPhone even though many realise that newly launched products are generally faulty/buggy.

In a similar manner, while visiting websites, people may just look at the brand or corporate, and assuming that brands and corporates follow all legal and privacy regulations, they may completely ignore what they are disclosing. This may inturn produce the opposite effect of what was desired by formalizing a website.

Just because people feel more friendly on a casual website does not mean that would be more careful while navigating a more formal one.
