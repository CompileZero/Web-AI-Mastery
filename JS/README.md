# JS For Humans

## Yet Another JavaScript Book?

I know, I know. Holding this (digital) book in your hand right now, you‚Äòre
probably wondering, why do we need yet another book on JavaScript? Aren‚Äòt there
already too many?

Don‚Äòt worry, I‚Äòll answer the question. But before that, let‚Äôs take a quick
rewind of my dreadful JavaScript Journey.

Well, I had a very modest beginning with JavaScript. For days on end, I couldn‚Äòt
understand where I exactly needed to use JavaScript. Learning HTML & CSS was
already a Herculean task for me. One more language just to create a lame
website?

I battled with the initial JavaScript hiccups (Data Types, Variables,
Conditionals, Loops etc.).

Then those hiccups started turning into coughs.

I ran into terms like Object-Oriented, Multi Paradigm, Functional, Hoisting,
Polymorphism etc, and it left my head spinning. (Trust me, it still does today).
But the real problem wasn‚Äôt just that.

I couldn‚Äôt find a single resource, that:
1. Was directed at beginners, 
2. Explained concepts in simple language,
3. Provided a roadmap to go from a beginner to intermediate and then advanced JS Developer
4. And finally also took care of the advanced and expert level JavaScript
concepts.

### `So again, What is this all about?`

Many people have a certain hatred towards programming. This hatred arises out of
the fear of the unknown.

10-20 Known Programming Languages, Thousands of non-understandable sentences,
wrapping your head around 100-200 Concepts in Computer Science. (Which, by the way, is just the tip of the iceberg.)

And then, just like that, some new technology comes around, and whatever was
learned becomes redundant. Right?

Absolutely Wrong.

The book begins by addressing this and many other issues, that people have when
they start programming.

This said, this book is solely focused on :

1. Learning JavaScript
2. Mastering the fundamentals of how JavaScript works
3. Providing a roadmap of how to go from a beginner, to intermediate, to an advanced JS Developer.
4. Learning the Advanced Concepts
5. Becoming one of the top JS Developers in the world.

## Who is this book for?

#### This book assumes that you are at least familiar with concepts of HTML & CSS (You probably wouldn‚Äôt have come across this book otherwise). Anyways, if by chance you don‚Äôt know HTML & CSS, I would recommend you start by learning those technologies first, and then leave everything to this book.

##### P.S.: If you‚Äòre just looking out to become a backend developer, then maybe you could do fine just learning JavaScript (although I don‚Äòt recommend this at all. Get some hands-on with HTML & CSS. They are quite interesting :P)

<!-- TODO: Add HTML CSS Links Here-->

All said, this book is especially for:

1. Beginner Devs:
   1. Students/Developers who have had minimal programming experience (probably
      just in school/college) and want to learn web development.
   2. Devs Who have some basic understanding of HTML & CSS, and want to start
      learning JS, but find it confusing.
2. Intermediate Devs:
   1. Developers who are familiar with Basic JavaScript Concepts; have used
      their coding skills to create some basic Interactive Web Pages, and now want to understand advanced level JavaScript.
   2. Developers who have worked for more than 3-4 Years on some other
      programming language, and now want to dive into the world of
      web-development.
